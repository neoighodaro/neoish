The second episode of the [Laravel Worldwide Meetup](https://meetup.laravel.com) happened on the <date>25th of August</date>. There, I gave a talk about some of the lessons I learned while working with an [API that handles over 300 million records daily](https://twitter.com/aboutyou_tech). Because of the Coronavirus :/ we had to hold the meetup remotely but it was a success nonetheless.

Thanks to [Freek](https://freek.dev) for hosting it.
